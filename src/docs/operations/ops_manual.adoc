WARNING: gsutil rsync uses hashes when modification time is not available at
both the source and destination. Your crcmod installation isn't using the
module's C extension, so checksumming will run very slowly. If this is your
first rsync since updating gsutil, this rsync can take significantly longer than
usual. For help installing the extension, please see "gsutil help crcmod".

== (key) Performance Indications

TODO: https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project//[Firebase Performance]

=== Application KPIs -- Server

=== KPIs -- Client

== Known Limitations

=== Functional Limitations

generation of automatic anthropometric results TBA

=== Technical Limitations

works only on Google Project Tango smartphones

=== Limitations from Capacity

frames per second recording

== Archiving and Deleting Data

All data can related to persons by a simple, human generatable code.
This code is printed as a QR code on the informed consent to ensure
data protection.
Data access CRUD is enabled with this code.

=== Transaction Data (fast Growing Data)

temporal data is deleted 2 years after conclusion of project or earlier

=== Master Data (slowly Growing Data)

master data is kept as long as consent applies.

=== Log Files and Error Files

only stored in [crashlytics](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/

=== Capacity Management

Google Cloud Platform

=== Capacity Recording and Monitoring

Google Firebase

=== Regular Review of Capacity Utilization
