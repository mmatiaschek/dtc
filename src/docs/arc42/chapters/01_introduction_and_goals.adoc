== Introduction and Goals

DAMA is a multiplayer platform for playing checkers online against friends or other unknown players.
For a VAS subscription of daily 2 Birr you get daily 100 coins which allows on average for 10 games. Game cost can depend on skill of player, there are different levels of cost and potential winnings per game.

You can get additional coins by 

- one-off payment
- winning against other players
- inviting friends

At the end you can "cash out" by getting products (eg shampoo with 10,000 coins)

The business goal is to maximize profits.

****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****

=== Requirements Overview


Main driving force for the game is to acquire as many players as possible and have them play as many games as possible to create revenue. For this gamification and audiovisual feedback is used to reward players.

The game should enable users to easily

- sign up or sign in
- subscribe and unsubscribe to daily credits
- check their current credits
- start a game of checkers with friends or strangers currently online
- get a reward when they win
- get a reward for daily log in
- practice against computer without winning credits?
- invite friends to a game (possibly for reward of credit when inviting a new player)
- see their rank (i.e. ELO based "you are ranked No. 234 of 22422 players" or military tiers that fit with the theme of the game "King", "General", ...)

KPIs

- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- # completed games daily
- # completed games monthly
- Avg. wait time for starting a new game
- % of game requests where game was cancelled after waiting > 3 seconds
- % of game requests where wait time was > 20 seconds

.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
****

[cols="5,5,5"]
|===
| Priority
| Quality Goal
| Scenario

| 1
| Security
| As the game handles VAS for the user, it must not be possible by third parties to abuse the billing system

| 2
| Transparency
| Payments through VAS must be transparent in order to ensure trust of users and them recommending DAMA to friends

| 3
| Compatibility
| The game must be compatible with the primary compute platform and app distribution channel of the target demographic

| 4
| Reliability
| Ongoing games must not be interruped, rewards must be fairly distributed

| 5
| Functional Suitability
| Whenever users have time for a quick game, they should be able to do it without long wait time for opponents

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
